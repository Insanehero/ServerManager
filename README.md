# Server Manager

I created this project to help with development work flow on distrubuted server systems. In it's current state it's pretty biased towards my own system for MineSwine, but I intend to make it more agile.

This is one of my largest personal projects to date. As the project got larger and larger, I quickly learned the evils of project entropy and what to do on future projects to avoid it. In the near future I hope to recode a lot of the SSH action execution system to be a lot more modularized and clean cut as well as the rest of the API.

This was the also the first time I've used ReactJS, which I now feel like I have firm understanding of after diving head first into it. It's now my favorite frontend framework! Some of the ReactJS code is a little messy and scattered, but I'm pretty proud of it for being my first ReactJS project.
